<a id="gameplay" class="anchor" href="#gameplay" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>XO with AI Gameplay</h3>

<p>This game is based on the “Tic Tac Toe” with a new challenge to win as many rounds in a row as you can. The game has Artificial Intelligence (AI) which competes with the player and when he develop a new strategy, AI develops a counter strategy. This produces the effect of increasing difficulty. The goal of a player is to create a strategy to slow down the progress of AI. It is not difficult to get 20-30 wins, but the fun starts when the player goal is to get 100.</p>

<a id="mobile" class="anchor" href="#mobile" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile</h3>

<p>This game is live and available on Firefox marketplace. To installing it on your device, one needs to have a Firefox browser, then open the link:  <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/xo-with-ai/">https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/xo-with-ai/</a> and follow the prompts.</p>

<a id="tools" class="anchor" href="#tools" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tools</h3>

<p>Before creating and developing this game, I created the library MYASO for managing complicated, time consuming and error critical operations. The library and sample application are available for downloading. It includes artificial intelligence and a graphics engine. With the library a programmer can create new classes for objects, groups of objects and cameras. Those classes are passed as parameters in a WebGL management class that interacts with the WebGL and refreshes the scene. The library has a class for artificial intelligence that accepts the game status data, makes a decision on the next move and learns from the changes in the game state.</p>

<a id="artificial-intelligence" class="anchor" href="#artificial-intelligence" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<p>AI in the game works as a hybrid of neural networks and Simulated Annealing algorithms. Execution consists of three steps. The first action sees the game state and checks it's memory to determine if there are any good moves for the situation. If there are, it uses the one with the best value that comes from learning. If there are none, it tries randomly to make a move. The second action is learning that calculates the fitness (how good the move is) of the AI move and the move of the player. And saves the result to the memory. The third action is forgetting - after some period of time, it starts moving the values to zero and  those with a zero value get removed. With this game, forgetting is not a problem. It becomes more difficult when you start moving from one dimension to multidimensional space.</p>

<h3>
<a id="graphics" class="anchor" href="#graphics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Graphics</h3>

<p>The graphical part of the game starts from creating models in an app. The models are stored as JSON. The program reads  and passes it to the game engine for rendering. The engine saves objects in its array and uses them for refreshing the game scene. When the game starts, the engine has only the board in its array and displays it. After players and the AI start making moves, new elements "X" and "O" are added to the array for rendering. At the end of the game, the buffer gets cleared.</p>

<a id="web-front-end-and-ui" class="anchor" href="#web-front-end-and-ui" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web front end and UI</h3>

<p>User interface consists of "div" elements that act like a window. Navigation between the windows is done with active elements that make loading a window visible, perform all necessary operations for the requested window and makes it active after preparation. In the game, interaction happens through invisible active components that give imitation of the interactions with 3D world. The game data is stored on a device with a  "localStorage" class. The body of the page is configured with CSS to act like an application.</p>
